# Machine-Learning-Coursework
Implement and test basic/common machine learning algorithms in python with the use of Numpy.


### HW1
1. Study scikit-learn API to use decision tree classier to classify real vs. fake news headlines with given TF-IDF vectors which at to be extracted from word corpus.
2. After splitting the given training data, compute the information gain of the split which will be compared with the Gini coefficient criteria.
3. Perform a K-fold cross-validation procedure to tune the penalty parameter on a self-implemented Ridge regression model with the use of MSE computed weight. Evaluate Performances.

### HW2
1. Implement the k-nearest neighbor algorithm, plain logistic regression model, and penalized logistic regression model. Examine the performance of implemented algorithms and report the best working hyperparameter setting.
2. Implement an emotion classifier algorithm by training a 2-hidden-layer deep neural network with backpropagation. Examine performance and report best hyperparameter settings.

### HW3
1. Implement maximum likelihood estimator and maximum A posteriori probability estimator for fitting a Naive Bayes model. Compare the accuracy of the two estimators.
2. Generate a Naive Bayes model to create a handwritten number classifier.

### HW4
1. Implement two unsupervised learning algorithms --- k-means clustering algorithm and EM algorithm for Gaussian mixture. 
2. Build a reinforcement learning algorithm --- Q learning algorithm for discovering the optimal path to goal in a given environment.
